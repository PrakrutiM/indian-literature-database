# Database_Of_Indian_Literature

The 'Database of Indian Literature' aims at developing a multilingual database of Indian Literature in the 22 official Indian languages, of creative works published from 1950 to 1990, to decolonize the idea of what is considered 'Indian' in literary studies, and to present a database design that incorporates multiplicity of the languages in its structuring logic.
 
This repository is being used by Prakruti Maniar towards the creation of a mysql database of Indian literature post-independence. It includes a .sql file to novels and short-story collections in four Indian languages - English, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi - from the years 1965-1985. The raw dataset in CSV and the .sql dataset is available upon request. Please write to prakruti.maniar94@gmail.com, stating your nature of your project, and for how long and to what end you intend to use the dataset.
