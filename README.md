# Database of Indian Literature

The 'Database of Indian Literature' aims at developing a multilingual database of Indian Literature in the 22 official Indian languages, of creative works published from 1950 to 1990, to decolonize the idea of what is considered 'Indian' in literary studies, and to present a database design that incorporates multiplicity of the languages in its structuring logic.
