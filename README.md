# Database_Of_Indian_Literature
 
This repository is being used by Prakruti Maniar towards the creation of a mysql database of Indian literature post-independence. It includes a .sql file to novels and short-story collections in four Indian languages - English, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi - from the years 1965-1985. The raw dataset in CSV and the .sql dataset is available upon request. Please write to prakruti.maniar94@gmail.com, stating your nature of your project, and for how long and to what end you intend to use the dataset.
